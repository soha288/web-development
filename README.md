# 🌐 Task 1 – Responsive Webpage

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** of the **Web Development Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**.

## 📋 Task Objective
“Create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item.

The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages.

Use:
    HTML to structure the menu,
    CSS to style it, and
    JavaScript to add interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.”

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For structuring the content
- **CSS3** – For layout, styling, and responsiveness (Flexbox, Media Queries)
- **JavaScript** – For basic interactivity

## 📌 Key Features

- Fixed navigation bar with hover effects
